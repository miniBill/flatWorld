1. How to build flatWorld
=========================

In order to build flatWorld, you're going to need CMake 2.6 or higher installed.

Run the following commands when you're ready to build the project:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Note that you could very well run cmake in the project's root, but creating a
"build" directory is recommended, as to segregate source files from temporary
project files, and to allow the easy removal of those temporary files.
